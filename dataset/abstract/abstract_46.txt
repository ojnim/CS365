We present a benchmark in six European languages containing manually annotated information about olfactory situations and events
following a FrameNet-like approach. The documents selection covers ten domains of interest to cultural historians in the olfactory domain and includes texts published between
1620 to 1920, allowing a diachronic analysis
of smell descriptions. With this work, we aim
to foster the development of olfactory information extraction approaches as well as the analysis of changes in smell descriptions over time
