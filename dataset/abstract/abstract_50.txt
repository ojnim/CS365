Language change has often been conceived
as a competition between linguistic variants.
However, language units may be complex organizations in themselves, e.g. in the case of
schematic constructions, featuring a free slot.
Such a slot is filled by words forming a set
or ’paradigm’ and engaging in inter-related
dynamics within this constructional environment. To tackle this complexity, a simple
computational method is offered to automatically characterize their interactions, and visualize them through networks of cooperation
and competition. Applying this method to the
French paradigm of quantifiers, I show that this
method efficiently captures phenomena regarding the evolving organization of constructional
paradigms, in particular the constitution of competing clusters of fillers that promote different
semantic strategies overall.
