This paper describes the LingJing teamâ€™s
method to the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social
Media Analysis (WASSA) 2022 shared task
on Personality Prediction (PER) and Reactivity Index Prediction (IRI). In this paper, we
adopt the prompt-based method with the pretrained language model to accomplish these
tasks. Specifically, the prompt is designed to
provide knowledge of the extra personalized information for enhancing the pre-trained model.
Data augmentation and model ensemble are
adopted for obtaining better results. Extensive
experiments are performed, which shows the
effectiveness of the proposed method. On the final submission, our system achieves a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient of 0.2301 and 0.2546
on Track 3 and Track 4 respectively. We ranked
1st on both sub-tasks.
