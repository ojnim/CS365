Entity linking disambiguates mentions by mapping them to entities in a knowledge graph
(KG). One important question in todayâ€™s research is how to extend neural entity linking
systems to new domains. In this paper, we aim
at a system that enables linking mentions to entities from a general-domain KG and a domainspecific KG at the same time. In particular,
we represent the entities of different KGs in
a joint vector space and address the questions
of which data is best suited for creating and
fine-tuning that space, and whether fine-tuning
harms performance on the general domain. We
find that a combination of data from both the
general and the special domain is most helpful.
The first is especially necessary for avoiding
performance loss on the general domain. While
additional supervision on entities that appear in
both KGs performs best in an intrinsic evaluation of the vector space, it has less impact on
the downstream task of entity linking.
