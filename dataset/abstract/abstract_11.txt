Detecting emotion in text allows social and
computational scientists to study how people
behave and react to online events. However,
developing these tools for different languages
requires data that is not always available. This
paper collects the available emotion detection
datasets across 19 languages. We train a multilingual emotion prediction model for social
media data, XLM-EMO. The model shows
competitive performance in a zero-shot setting,
suggesting it is helpful in the context of lowresource languages. We release our model to
the community so that interested researchers
can directly use it.
