We build a system that leverages adapters, a
light weight and efficient method for leveraging
large language models to perform the task Empathy and Distress prediction tasks for WASSA
2022. In our experiments, we find that stacking
our empathy and distress adapters on a pretrained emotion classification adapter performs
best compared to full fine-tuning approaches
and emotion feature concatenation. We make
our experimental code publicly available
