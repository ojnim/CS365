Classification of posts in social media such as
Twitter is difficult due to the noisy and short
nature of texts. Sequence classification models
based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) are
popular for classifying posts that are sequential
in nature. RNNs assume the hidden representation dynamics to evolve in a discrete manner and do not consider the exact time of the
posting. In this work, we propose to use recurrent neural ordinary differential equations (RNODE) for social media post classification which
consider the time of posting and allow the computation of hidden representation to evolve in
a time-sensitive continuous manner. In addition, we propose a novel model, Bi-directional
RNODE (Bi-RNODE), which can consider the
information flow in both the forward and backward directions of posting times to predict the
post label. Our experiments demonstrate that
RNODE and Bi-RNODE are effective for the
problem of stance classification of rumours in
social media.
