Computational comprehension and identifying
emotional components in language have been
critical in enhancing human-computer connection in recent years. The WASSA 2022 Shared
Task introduced four tracks and released a
dataset of news stories: Track-1 for Empathy
and Distress Prediction, Track-2 for Emotion
classification, Track-3 for Personality prediction, and Track-4 for Interpersonal Reactivity
Index prediction at the essay level. This paper
describes our participation in the WASSA 2022
shared task on the tasks mentioned above. We
developed multi-task deep learning methods to
address Tracks 1 and 2 and machine learning
models for Track 3 and 4. Our developed systems achieved average Pearson scores of 0.483,
0.05, and 0.08 for Track 1, 3, and 4, respectively, and a macro F1 score of 0.524 for Track
2 on the test set. We ranked 8th, 11th, 2nd and
2
nd for tracks 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
