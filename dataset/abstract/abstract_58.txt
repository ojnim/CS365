Detecting emotions in languages is important
to accomplish a complete interaction between
humans and machines. This paper describes
our contribution to the WASSA 2022 shared
task which handles this crucial task of emotion detection. We have to identify the following emotions: sadness, surprise, neutral, anger,
fear, disgust, joy based on a given essay text.
We are using an ensemble of ELECTRA and
BERT models to tackle this problem achieving
an F1 score of 62.76%.
