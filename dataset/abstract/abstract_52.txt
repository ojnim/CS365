We propose a morphology-based method for
low-resource (LR) dependency parsing. We
train a morphological inflector for target LR
languages, and apply it to related rich-resource
(RR) treebanks to create cross-lingual (xinflected) treebanks that resemble the target
LR language. We use such inflected treebanks
to train parsers in zero- (training on x-inflected
treebanks) and few-shot (training on x-inflected
and target language treebanks) setups. The results show that the method sometimes improves
the baselines, but not consistently.
