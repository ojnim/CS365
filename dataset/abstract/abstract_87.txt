To understand a story with multiple events,
it is important to capture the proper relations
across these events. However, existing event
relation extraction (ERE) frameworks regard
it as a multi-class classification task, and do
not guarantee any coherence between different relation types. For instance, if a phone
line died after storm, then it is evident that
the storm happened before the died. Current
frameworks of event relation extraction do not
guarantee this anti-symmetry and thus enforce
it via a constraint loss function (Wang et al.,
2020). In this work, we propose to modify
the underlying ERE model to guarantee coherence by representing each event as a box representation (BERE) without applying explicit
constraints. Our experiments show that BERE
has stronger conjunctive constraint satisfaction
while performing on par or better in terms
of F1 compared to previous models with constraint injection.
