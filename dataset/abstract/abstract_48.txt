In this paper, we aim to introduce a Cognitive
Linguistics perspective into a computational
analysis of near-synonyms. We focus on a single set of Dutch near-synonyms, vernielen and
vernietigen, roughly translated as ‘to destroy’,
replicating the analysis from Geeraerts (1997)
with distributional models. Our analysis, which
tracks the meaning of both words in a corpus of
16th-20th century prose data, shows that both
lexical items have undergone semantic change,
led by differences in their prototypical semantic
core.
