Numerous analyses of reading time (RT) data
have been implemented—all in the effort
to better understand the cognitive processes
driving reading comprehension. However,
data measured on words at the end of a
sentence—or even at the end of a clause—is
often omitted due to the confounding factors introduced by so-called “wrap-up effects,” which
manifests as a skewed distribution of RTs for
these words. Consequently, the community’s
understanding of the cognitive processes that
might be involved in these wrap-up effects
is limited. In this work, we attempt to learn
more about these processes by examining
the relationship between wrap-up effects
and information-theoretic quantities, such as
word and context surprisals. We find that the
distribution of information in prior contexts is
often predictive of sentence- and clause-final
RTs (while not of sentence-medial RTs). This
lends support to several prior hypotheses about
the processes involved in wrap-up effects.
