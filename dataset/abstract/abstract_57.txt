Over the years, the review helpfulness prediction task has been the subject of several works,
but remains being a challenging issue in Natural Language Processing, as results vary a lot
depending on the domain, on the adopted features and on the chosen classification strategy.
This paper attempts to evaluate the impact of
content features and classification methods for
two different domains. In particular, we run
our experiments for a low resource language –
Portuguese –, trying to establish a benchmark
for this language. We show that simple features and classical classification methods are
powerful for the task of helpfulness prediction,
but are largely outperformed by a convolutional
neural network-based solution.
