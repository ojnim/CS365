Languages around the world employ classifier
systems as a method of semantic organization
and categorization. These systems are rife with
variability, violability, and ambiguity, and are
prone to constant change over time. We explicitly model change in classifier systems as the
population-level outcome of child language acquisition over time in order to shed light on the
factors that drive change to classifier systems.
Our research consists of two parts: a contrastive
corpus study of Cantonese and Mandarin childdirected speech to determine the role that ambiguity and homophony avoidance may play in
classifier learning and change followed by a series of population-level learning simulations of
an abstract classifier system. We find that acquisition without reference to ambiguity avoidance
is sufficient to drive broad trends in classifier
change and suggest an additional role for adults
and discourse factors in classifier death.
