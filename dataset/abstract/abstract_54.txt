In this paper we present a set of multilingual experiments tackling the task of Stance Detection
in five different languages: English, Spanish,
Catalan, French and Italian. Furthermore, we
study the phenomenon of stance with respect
to six different targets – one per language, and
two different for Italian – employing a variety
of machine learning algorithms that primarily
exploit morphological and syntactic knowledge
as features, represented throughout the format
of Universal Dependencies. Results seem to
suggest that the methodology employed is not
beneficial per se, but might be useful to exploit
the same features with a different methodology
