We advance the state-of-the-art in unsupervised abstractive dialogue summarization by
utilizing multi-sentence compression graphs.
Starting from well-founded assumptions about
word graphs, we present simple but reliable path-reranking and topic segmentation
schemes. Robustness of our method is demonstrated on datasets across multiple domains,
including meetings, interviews, movie scripts,
and day-to-day conversations. We also identify possible avenues to augment our heuristicbased system with deep learning. We opensource our code1
, to provide a strong, reproducible baseline for future research into unsupervised dialogue summarization.
