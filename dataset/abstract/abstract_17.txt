Zero-shot relation extraction (ZSRE) aims to
predict target relations that cannot be observed
during training. While most previous studies
have focused on fully supervised relation extraction and achieved considerably high performance, less effort has been made towards
ZSRE. This study proposes a new model incorporating discriminative embedding learning for
both sentences and semantic relations. In addition, a self-adaptive comparator network is used
to judge whether the relationship between a sentence and a relation is consistent. Experimental
results on two benchmark datasets showed that
the proposed method significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods.
