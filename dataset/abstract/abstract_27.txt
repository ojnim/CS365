For task-oriented dialog agents, the tone of
voice mediates user-agent interactions, playing a central role in the flow of a conversation. Distinct from domain-agnostic politeness
constructs, in specific domains such as online
stores, booking platforms, and others, agents
need to be capable of adopting highly specific
vocabulary, with significant impact on lexical
and grammatical aspects of utterances. Then,
the challenge is on improving utterancesâ€™ politeness while preserving the actual content, an
utterly central requirement to achieve the task
goal. In this paper, we conduct a novel assessment of politeness strategies for task-oriented
dialog agents under a transfer learning scenario. We extend existing generative and
rewriting politeness approaches, towards overcoming domain-shifting issues, and enabling
the transfer of politeness patterns to a novel
domain. Both automatic and human evaluation is conducted on customer-store interactions, over the fashion domain, from which
contribute with insightful and experimentally
supported lessons regarding the improvement
of politeness in task-specific dialog agents.
