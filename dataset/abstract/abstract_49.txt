Contextual word embedding techniques for semantic shift detection are receiving more and
more attention. In this paper, we present What
is Done is Done (WiDiD), an incremental approach to semantic shift detection based on
incremental clustering techniques and contextual embedding methods to capture the changes
over the meanings of a target word along a diachronic corpus. In WiDiD, the word contexts
observed in the past are consolidated as a set
of clusters that constitute the “memory” of the
word meanings observed so far. Such a memory is exploited as a basis for subsequent word
observations, so that the meanings observed in
the present are stratified over the past ones.
