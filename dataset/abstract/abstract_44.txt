In this paper we investigate how concreteness
and abstractness are represented in word embedding spaces. We use data for English and
German, and show that concreteness and abstractness can be determined independently and
turn out to be completely opposite directions in
the embedding space. Various methods can be
used to determine the direction of concreteness,
always resulting in roughly the same vector.
Though concreteness is a central aspect of the
meaning of words and can be detected clearly
in embedding spaces, it seems not as easy to
subtract or add concreteness to words to obtain other words or word senses like e.g. can be
done with a semantic property like gender.
