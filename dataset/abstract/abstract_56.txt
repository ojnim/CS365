Emotion is the essential attribute of human beings. Perceiving and understanding emotions
in a human-like manner is the most central part
of developing emotional intelligence. This paper describes the contribution of the LingJing
team’s method to the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment &
Social Media Analysis (WASSA) 2022 shared
task on Emotion Classification. The participants are required to predict seven emotions
from empathic responses to news or stories that
caused harm to individuals, groups, or others.
This paper describes the continual pre-training
method for the masked language model (MLM)
to enhance the DeBERTa pre-trained language
model. Several training strategies are designed
to further improve the final downstream performance including the data augmentation with
the supervised transfer, child-tuning training,
and the late fusion method. Extensive experiments on the emotional classification dataset
show that the proposed method outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
our method’s effectiveness. Moreover, our submission ranked Top-1 with all metrics in the
evaluation phase for the Emotion Classification
task.
