In recent years, a flurry of morphological
datasets had emerged, most notably UniMorph,
a multi-lingual repository of inflection tables.
However, the flat structure of the current morphological annotation schema makes the treatment of some languages quirky, if not impossible, specifically in cases of polypersonal agreement, where verbs agree with multiple arguments using true affixes. In this paper we propose to address this phenomenon, by expanding
the UniMorph annotation schema to hierarchical feature structure that naturally accommodates complex argument marking. We apply
this extended schema to one such language,
Georgian, and provide a human-verified, accurate and balanced morphological dataset for
Georgian verbs. The dataset has 4 times more
tables and 6 times more verb forms compared
to the existing UniMorph dataset, covering all
possible variants of argument marking, demonstrating the adequacy of our proposed scheme.
Experiments with a standard reinflection model
show that generalization is easy when the data
is split at the form level, but extremely hard
when splitting along lemma lines. Expanding
the other languages in UniMorph to this schema
is expected to improve both the coverage, consistency and interpretability of this benchmark.
