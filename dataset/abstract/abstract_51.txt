Incorrect labels in training data occur when human annotators make mistakes or when the data
is generated via weak or distant supervision. It
has been shown that complex noise-handling
techniques - by modeling, cleaning or filtering
the noisy instances - are required to prevent
models from fitting this label noise. However,
we show in this work that, for text classification tasks with modern NLP models like BERT,
over a variety of noise types, existing noisehandling methods do not always improve its
performance, and may even deteriorate it, suggesting the need for further investigation. We
also back our observations with a comprehensive analysis.
