Automatic readability assessment (ARA) aims at classifying the readability level of a passage automatically. In the past, manually selected linguistic features are used to classify the pas- sages. However, as the use of deep neural net- work surges, there is less work focusing on these linguistic features. Recently, many works integrate linguistic features with pre-trained language model (PLM) to make up for the in- formation that PLMs are not good at capturing. Despite their initial success, insufficient anal- ysis of the long passage characteristic of ARA has been done before. To further investigate the promotion of linguistic features on PLMs in ARA from the perspective of passage length, with commonly used linguistic features and abundant experiments, we find that: (1) Lin- guistic features promote PLMs in ARA mainly on long passages. (2) The promotion of the fea- tures on PLMs becomes less significant when the dataset size exceeds âˆ¼ 750 passages. (3) Our results suggest that Newsela is possibly not suitable for ARA.
