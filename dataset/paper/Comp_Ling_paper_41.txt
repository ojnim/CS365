Recent approaches to knowledge-intensive NLP
tasks combine neural network based models with a
retrieval component that leverages dense vector representations (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020;
Petroni et al., 2021). The most straightforward example is question answering, where the retriever
receives as input a question and returns relevant
documents to be used by the reader (both encoder
and decoder), which outputs the answer (Chen,
2020). The same approach can also be applied in
other contexts, such as fact-checking (Tchechmedjiev et al., 2019) or knowledgable dialogue (Dinan
et al., 2018). Moreover, this paradigm can also
be applied to systems that utilize e.g. caching of
contexts from the training corpus to provide better
output, such as the k-nearest neighbours language
model proposed by Khandelwal et al. (2019) or
the dynamic gating language model mechanism by
Yogatama et al. (2021). All these pipelines are generalized as retrieving an artefact from a knowledge
base (Zouhar et al., 2021) on which the reader is
conditioned together with the query.
Crucially, all of the previous examples rely on
the quality of the retrieval component and the
knowledge base. The knowledge base is usually
indexed by dense vector representations1
and the
retrieval component performs maximum similarity search, commonly using the inner product or
the L
2 distance, to retrieve documents2
from the
knowledge base. Only the index alone takes up a
large amount of size of the knowledge base, making deployment and experimentation very difficult.
The retrieval speed is also dependent on the dimensionality of the index vector. An example of a
large knowledge base is the work of Borgeaud et al.
(2021) which performs retrieval over a database of
1.8 billion documents.
This paper focuses on the issue of compressing
the index through dimensionality and precision reduction and makes the following contributions:
• Comparison of various unsupervised index
compression methods for retrieval, including
random projections, PCA, autoencoder, precision reduction and their combination.
• Examination of effective pre- and postprocessing transformations, showing that centering and normalization are necessary for
boosting the performance.
• Analysis on the impact of adding irrelevant
documents and retrieval errors. Recommendations for use by practicioners.
In Section 3, we describe the problem scenario
and the experimental setup. We discuss the results
of different compression methods in Section 4. We
provide further analysis in Section 5 and conclude
with usage recommendations in Section 6. The
repository for this project is available open-source.
In this work, we examined several simple unsupervised methods for dimensionality reduction for
retrieval-based NLP tasks: random projections,
PCA, autoencoder and precision reduction and their
combination. We also documented the data requirements of each method and their reliance on preand post-processing.
